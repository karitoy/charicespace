		In early 2007, a face-off video between Bianca Ryan and a little Asian girl was uploaded by Youtube user FalseVoice. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Most viewers could hardly believe that such a rich, deep and full voice can come from such a small, young body. 
		</p>
		<p>
		What the viewers did not know then was that that little girl was singing not so much for pleasure as to survive; 
		there were times when the only thing keeping her family from starving was her voice.
		</p>
		<p>
		A lot has happened since then; the little girl became a Youtube sensation that led to invitations to Ellen DeGeneres's,
		Paul O'Grady's and Oprah's shows.
		</p>
		<p>This site is all about that little girl whose rise to stardom against the odds continues to inspire.</p>
		<p>Hope you enjoy and thanks for visiting!</p>
